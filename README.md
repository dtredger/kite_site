# kite_site

http://kite-site-app.herokuapp.com/

This is a kiteboarding directory rails app. It lists countries and kite-spots, and lets a user sign up and favourite them.
Currently it has some basic searching, and the ability to calculate distance from the user. 

Uses:

* Rails 6.1

* Heroku (free dyno—it goes to sleep, so please be patient while it wakes up)

* DigitalOcean Spaces for storage

* ActiveStorage for files

* Unsplash API for placeholder images

* Wikipedia-scraped placeholder descriptions


All the actual code is secret (⌐□_□)
